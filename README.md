# Brainfuck Code!
I did some codes on brainfuck and sometimes I keep doing things with that esolang. Here I put all those codes I've made.

# How to use it
If you want to try one of these codes, you will need a compiler or an interpreter for brainfuck. I use [this interpreter](http://www.bf.doleczek.pl/) to do my Brainfuck programs. If you use it just copy the raw text of any .b file and paste it on the website. After that just press "Run program" or "CTRL+ENTER"
